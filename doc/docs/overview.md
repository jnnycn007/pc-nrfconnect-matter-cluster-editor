# Overview and user interface

The {{app_name}} main window displays the basic information about the Matter cluster. The user interface broadly follows the organization of other nRF Connect for Desktop apps.

When you start the {{app_name}}, the application main window appears with the **Cluster** tab selected by default and its main panel empty.

![{{app_name}} default view at startup](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_standard_view.png "{{app_name}} default view at startup")

!!! info "Tip"
    You can learn about tool functionalities directly from the tool interface by hovering your mouse over elements to see dedicated tooltips with information about each element.

## Side panel sections

On the left side of the tool, the app includes several UI elements for managing Matter cluster files.

![Side panel](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_side_panel.png "Side panel")

### XML Cluster File

The buttons in this section let you load Matter cluster XML files and save them.

| Button                   | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Load from file**       | Loads the cluster definition or cluster extension from an XML file.<br/><br/>Once you load a Matter cluster XML file, the [cluster name field](#cluster-name-field) above the XML Cluster File section changes to the name of the loaded cluster and all tabs are populated with the data from the loaded cluster.                           |
| **Save to file** | Saves the current cluster definition to an XML file.<br/><br/>This option is only available for new clusters.<br/><br/>The name should be unique across all available clusters in the Matter Data Model.  |

### XML Cluster Extension File

This tab includes the **Save extension to file** button, which checks the difference between the current filled-in values and the loaded cluster and saves the difference to an XML file.

The {{app_name}} automatically compares your current cluster with the originally loaded cluster and saves only the differences as an extension file. This means the following:

- Only newly added elements are included in the extension.
- Modified elements are included with their new values.
- Unchanged elements are not included in the extension.

If there is no difference, the tool shows a notification indicating that there is no data to create a cluster extension, as in the following figure:

![Save extension no difference](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_save_extension_no_difference.png "Save extension no difference")

### Cluster name field

This is the blue area at the top of the side panel sections. When you load a Matter cluster XML file, the name of the cluster is displayed here (for example, `NordicDevKit` in the following image.)

![Filled cluster name field above the side panels](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_name.png "Filled cluster name field above the side panels")

!!! info "Tip"
    You can change the name of the cluster by clicking on the name bar and typing a new name. The new name must be unique across all available clusters in the Matter Data Model.

If the file contains more than one cluster, the tool shows a notification with the list of available clusters, as in the following image.

![Load cluster file](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_load_multiple_clusters.png "Load cluster file")

Selecting a cluster from the list loads the cluster definition or cluster extension.

## Main window

The main app window shows the information for the currently selected tab.

The following tabs are available:

- Commands - Lists all commands assigned to the cluster.
- Attributes - Shows all attributes associated with the cluster.
- Events - Displays all events defined for the cluster.
- Structures - Lists all structure types defined for the cluster.
- Enums - Contains all enumeration types used by the cluster.
- Device type - Provides the device type definition.
- About - Application information and settings.

!!! info "Tip"
    A number in the top-right corner of a button indicates the current number of elements in the list.
    You can click the button to access the list.
    For example, the number in the following image indicates there are two items in the **Accesses** list.

## About tab

Here you can view application information, restore settings to default, access source code, and documentation. You also can find information on the selected device, access support tools, and enable verbose logging.

![{{app_name}} About tab](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_about_tab.png "{{app_name}} About tab")

## Log

The Log panel allows you to view the most important log events, tagged with a timestamp.

Given that the {{app_name}} does not interact with any devices, it does not use the Log panel. For this reason, the panel is hidden by default (the **SHOW LOG** toggle is disabled).

## Notifications

The tool validates that all required fields are filled before saving. If required fields are not filled, you will see an error message when trying to save the element:

![Edit window error](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_edit_box_error.png "Edit window error")

If there are no differences between the current cluster and the loaded cluster, the tool shows a message indicating no data to create an extension:

![Save extension no difference](./screenshots/matter_cluster_tool_save_extension_no_difference.png "Save extension no difference")
