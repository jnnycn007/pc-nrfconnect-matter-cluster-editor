# Matter Cluster Editor

The Matter data model defines clusters that are common for all manufacturers and
can be used as a base for devices. Sometimes, it is necessary to create a new
cluster for a specific device, or extend an existing cluster to add new
attributes, commands, or events that are specific to the device. This tool
allows you to perform such operations using a graphical user interface. If the
desired device type is not listed in the Matter Device Type Library
specification, you can use the tool to create a new one, and include it in the
project.
